# ftpserver
You might have already heard about FileZilla, a free FTP software. I, we tried to make the server and client editions and  install networking between two Windows PCs, using our own ftp server made with python.

The Client edition will help if you want to transfer files. If you want to make files available for others, you have to get the Server edition.

# features
can share text files, image, maybe small not so clear video files :(.
